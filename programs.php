	<div class="top_info">
	<p>There is a lot of vulnerable children in Tanzania whose future lives are evidently a game of chance. Uncertainity and lack of hope are still the major characteristics of a Tanzanian child, hence these children find themselfs in jeopardy most of the time. Historical backgrounds of the country and adherence of unnecessary traditional practices by some community members, are one of the significant causes of the set back of children's progress in Tanzania. Poverty and lack of education of most caretakers are one of the main reasons of children's rights' deprivation. According to a recent Unicef journal....? <a href="https://www.unicef.org/tanzania/media/2761/file/Journey%20of%20a%20Child%20in%20Tanzania.pdf" target="blank">Unicef on Children in Tanzania</a>. Recent studies show that there is still a big gap between poor and well-off families. Unfortunately, the poor families make the bigest part of the country's population. Children in poor families are deprived of their basic human rights. Right to education, right to food, shelter and clothing are just examples of what they lack. <a href="http://wbgfiles.worldbank.org/documents/hdn/ed/saber/supporting_doc/CountryReports/ECD/SABER_ECD_Tanzania_CR_Final_2012.pdf" target="blank">A pdf by WB</a> However, the existence of community based organizations like <a href="">Twiga Vision Tanzania</a> has become a relief for most families as they are now able to reach out for help in regard to the needs of their children and of the community as a whole.

	<div class="top_title"><h2>Women's Empowerment</h2></div>

	<div class="top_info">
	<p>We empower women through Twiga Vision's Women's Empwoerment Program. With this program, women are empowered by being provided with: business education, general health education and specific health education for women and children, basic legal education as well as providing them with handcraft skills that can help them run their families. Sometimes, we even provide them with small business capitals as a grant. Due to the fact that women carry the most responsibilities of looking after their families, we have come to a conclusion that supporting women is an inevitable obligation. Therefore our need for volunteers to support women is based on the forementioned fact. As a volunteer you can engage in one or more of the above tasks. We always put your prefrence first. All we need is just to know what it is that you prefer.<a href="index.php?#programs" class="program_back_link">Go back to the program list</a> or <a href="#primaryteaching" class="program_back_link">Read on</a></p>

	<div class="top_title"><h2>Primary School Teaching</h2></div>

	<div class="top_info">
	<p>We mainly work with goverment schools, schools that are state owned. You will be placed at a primary school as an assistant teacher, the local teacher will be there to work with you. In most cases, you will be expected to teach English, Maths and Sports and Games, because in Government school everything is taught in Swahili except English. We assume that Maths is a universal language you don't always have to use the local language to instruct the children, and so goes for sports and games. There is a big shortage of teachers in government schools it is even worse in rural areas. So, for you being a volunteer there, is a huge relief to the local teacher, so it is so much appreciate.

	<div class="top_info">
	<p>Working with this program gives you an opportunity to directly or indirectly impact the health of women and children as our main targets. You can do this in many ways and scales. For example you can provide basic health education to groups of women and children or you can take a more serious role of working in a health centre and healping people directly. Moreover, by providing food and/or medical support to families in need, you will have directly impacted those individuals on their health issue as well.

	<div class="top_info">
	<p>With this program we have a small scale Enviromental Conservation Program and  a large scale Enviromental Conservation Program. With the small scale program we work with primary schools to train students on issues concerning the Enviroment. For example, global warming,   deforestation and reforestation, garbage management and the different kinds of air polution. You can work with the primary school pupils to do activities like tree planting, rain water haverst projects, gardening and garbage management projects. With the large scale program, this is when you go to a remote village, where there is real serious issues about Enviromental distruction and be required to train the villageers on how they can improve the situation. With this project we are looking for sponsors and donors who can facilitate the intiation of tree nurseries and start deforestation compaigns. If you are a serious enviromentalist and you are concerned about the protection of the enviroment you might want to engage in the large scale program and bring a real change. <a href="index.php?#programs" class="program_back_link">Go back to the program list</a> or <a href="#childcare" class="program_back_link">Scrol to the top</a></p>
