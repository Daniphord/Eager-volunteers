Some children need sponsorship to be at Unique Choice Daycare Centre becasue their parents cannot afford the little fees charged by our Centre just to keep the centre running. You can do the following:</p>

                    <p class="sponsor__paragraph sponsor__paragraph--list">- pay for a child to be at Unique Choice daycare</p>
                    <p class="sponsor__paragraph sponsor__paragraph--list">- pay just for the food they get at school</p>
