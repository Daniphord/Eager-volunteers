      <div class="top_info">
          <p>We currently have only one option of accommodation for our volunteers and that is the Homestay option. Our volunteers are hosted by a host family that we call a Homestay. This is particularly good for those who would like to closely learn the African way of life. You get to know the typical African life with real examples. You experience how African family cook, how they dress and how they interact to each other and more importantly you become part of the family yourself! You get to know the life of local people better, because you will be there experiencing and witnessing everything with your own eyes. The local life you will experience include; local food, local music, their social life as well as studying their culture in depths. So for those of you who would like to dig a bit deeper into the African culture this is your place! </p>

        <div class="top_info">
          <p> You are given your own room that is lockable so you don't have to worry about your stuff being lost and for the family to make sure that your privacy is respected. You get a single bed, a table and a light. In some cases you have a private toilet, but in some cases you share the toilet with the rest of the family. The family provides you with breakfast and dinner. During meals you sit together with the family and eat together.The time for the meals is shared with you when you sign up, so you know exactly when to expect your breakfast and dinner. When you sign up there is an agreement as well, that talks about time to be home.</p>

    <div class="top_info">
          <p>Better be home before it gets dark, but when you have to return home late, then use our recommended list of taxi drivers to get home, whom you will be given their mobile numbers to call when you need them. We just advice you not to walk at night even when someone says, I will accompany you just don't. There are a lot of possible dangers for you doing that. If you can't reach any of the numbers we gave you then contact us directly and we will figure out how you get home safely.</p>
