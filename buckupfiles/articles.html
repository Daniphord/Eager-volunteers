                            The KIPEPEO Women's sewing group under Twiga Vision Tanzania is in need of sewing equipments and capital to start a sewing business. This project falls under our Livelihood program that aims at empowering families into acquring self-dependence. We have been doing this using a number of ways which include providing them with business training and providing them with small business capital so as to enable them to run successful busenesses. KIPEPEO is a Swahili word for a butterfly. We encourage our beneficiaries to have the freedom to fly like a butterfly does. This is to give them self-esteem and confidence in everything they do.

                            This was the best event ever! Our partners in Germany, the Prohl Family, organized an event to support us during this difficult time of the corona crisis. They organized a 200 metres run event which was incredibly successful. Many people participated and we were able to raise a huge amount. The reason for the event was that we could give food and probably medical support to the families of children who come to our daycare centres. It was a great success!

                            It was really good day to start working with Kim and Lena our new volunteers. We felt so blessed to have met these wonderful young volunteers. Their big generosity opened the doors for our new building project even wider!We will have two, working toilets soon, we will have the main room plastered, floor installed, doors and windows installed and probably the draft for the ceiling boards! Apart from that, Kim and Lena have helped us to buy 10 chairs for the children, 5 tables and paid the water bill as well as buying some teaching material for the teachers and children. Their time at KHM Day Care Centre is so much valued as they contribute a lot in terms of teaching both children and teacherws. We really thank The girls for their support, it has given us a lot of energy to continue fighting for better life for the people.

                            It was sad to see our two valuable volunteer leave. Ina and Johanna had became part of the programs. Nevertheless, their time has come to an end so they have to leave, to us it is really sad. Luckly, we got a fit replacement! Caroline and Claire alived and are going to fill the vacuum. That has given us a bit of relief. Both pairs are very active and supportive, they worked so hard to help us reach our goals, we hope by the time Caroline and Claire leave we will have acheive a lot! We hope to se them visit us again in the near future

It was a day when women from arround Arusha came to join other women for a discussion about their their rights and responsibilities. It was really a special day. Hope to do this again next year, this time it will be more organized.

These guys have done a lot to our project, especially on the area of improving the learning process of our children. Ina and Johanna, helped us to buy a lot of children's games as well as buying books for them to ready. On the other hand, Johanna and Ina helped the Malaika women a lot, in terms of helping with the selling of Malaikas locally. We miss you guys very much, we wish to you again soon!
