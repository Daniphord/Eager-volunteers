          <p> Volunteering in a foreign country is a great way to explore your life potentials while discovering the greatness of cultural diversities of the universe. Volunteering and internships are a great opportunity to learn about another country's cultural uniqueness while, at the same time, engaging in a humanitarian cause. You get to know the country in different ways and different perspectives than just being a tourist. You can help us support our local pertners in one (or more!) of the projects we support in the fields of education, social, health or womenâ€™s and youth empowerment and gain a substantial work experience. You will experience first-hand what it means to be in a foreign country and gather exciting intercultural experiences that will be invaluable for your future life.
