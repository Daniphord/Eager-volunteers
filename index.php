          <p> Volunteering is a great way to explore your life potentials while discovering the greatness of cultural diversity of the universe. Volunteering and internships are a great opportunity to learn about another country's cultural uniqueness while, at the same time, engaging in a humanitarian cause. You get to know the country in different ways and different perspectives than just being a tourist. You can help us support our Tanzanian team in one (or more!) of the projects we support in the fields of education, social, health or womenâ€™s and youth empowerment and gain valuable work experience. You will experience first-hand what it means to be in a foreign country and gather exciting intercultural experiences that will be invaluable for your future life.

We offer you a variety of projects, that you can engage in while volunteering with us. The most appealing ones are related to working with women, children and youths. We provide you with great placements in a variety of sectors this includes the health sector. You will work in Daycare centres, primary schools, women's groups, orphanage centres and health centres as well as in a hospitals.  </p>
